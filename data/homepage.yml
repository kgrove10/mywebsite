  title: "My Research"
  content: '</p>
  <p class="lead">
    My research takes a multi-method approach to understanding practices. Through in-depth interviews, intercept interviews, surveys, and experiments, I seek to examine how practices come to be formed, interrupted, abandoned, and recovered. My research also addresses the integration of practices within larger networks, such as prosocial consumer behavior in access-based platforms. The research I do is grounded in a desire to make theoretical contributions while also providing meaningful and impactful insights at the individual and community level.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    I also enjoy programming, earning a specialization in Data Science from the University of Oregon, and have used these skills to analyze data from social media, create this website, and construct a variety of data visualizations.

        Because I study practices, my teaching goal is to help my students develop their own practices. My classes empower my students to form practices of learning by applying their own experiences and knowledge to class material, embedding meaning, and forming competencies that allow them to identify and understand the marketing phenomena that surround them.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
