  title: "My Research"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    My research takes a multi-method approach to understanding practices. Through in-depth interviews, intercept interviews, surveys, and experiments, I seek to examine how practices come to be formed, interrupted, abandoned, and recovered. My research also addresses the integration of practices within larger networks, such as prosocial consumer behavior in collaborative consumption platforms. The research I do is grounded in a desire to make theoretical contributions while also providing meaningful and impactful insights at the individul and community level.

    I take a multi-disciplinary apprach to research, and served on a resiliance initiative grant team with members from Marketing, Psychology, Public Policy Planning and Management, and city officials to examine the impact of COVID-19 on transportation and behavior locally.For the past 3 years, I have worked with the local PeaceHealth Rides bicycle sharing program to provide insights into their infrastructure and users.

        Because I study practices, my teaching goal is to help my students develop their own practices. I want my classes to empower my students to form practices of learning by applying their own experiences and knowledge to class material, embedding meaning, and forming competencies that allow them to identify and understand the marketing phenomena that surround them.
